# Control

A simple game in unity with the theme out of control. This project is a single project in a series of projects aiming to mimic some cool games that were submitted to the GMTK game jam.

## Gameplay

The main purpose of the game is to control a ball in the middle of the field and shoot at enemy balls. the player then needs to consume the dropables generated by the enemy to increase his time. There is also a prince in the field that the player should avoid destroying. When the players timer reaches 0, the player gets out of control and shoots with an increased speed in 8 different directions, therefor increasing the chance that the prince gets hurt. The purpose of the player is to stay alive for the most time.

## Future work

Adding random obstcale spawn would increase the difficulty of the game and make it more fun.
